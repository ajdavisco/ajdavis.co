I'm AJ Davis, a UX researcher with over 15 years of experience in human-computer interaction (HCI) and digital optimization. My expertise spans qualitative methods such as field studies, ethnography, and usability testing, as well as quantitative approaches including A/B testing and behavioral analytics.

I hold an M.S. in Human Factors in Information Design from Bentley University and a B.A. in Economics from Wellesley College. Prior to founding Experiment Zone, I worked at Google, Clearhead, and Charles River Analytics, focusing on complex user research projects and innovative digital product optimization.

As the founder of [Experiment Zone](https://experimentzone.com){:target="_blank"}, I lead interdisciplinary teams in translating complex user insights into clear, actionable strategies. I'm also the host of [The Experiment Zone Podcast](https://experimentzone.com/podcast){:target="_blank"} and co-author of [_Usability for the World_](https://usabilityfortheworld.com){:target="_blank"}, a book dedicated to improving global usability across diverse communities.

I'm passionate about mentoring other UX researchers and CRO strategists, advising startups, and exploring the rapidly evolving field of human-AI collaboration. I'm always eager to share insights, discuss new ideas, and collaborate on books, podcasts, conferences, or other innovative projects.
