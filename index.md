## Hi! I'm AJ Davis.

I'm a UX researcher with 15+ years of experience using qualitative and quantitative methods—such as usability testing, A/B testing, and behavioral analytics—to optimize digital experiences. My passion is empowering businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions and deliver exceptional user experiences.


I'm the founder of [Experiment Zone](/experiment-zone/), host of [The Experiment Zone Podcast](/thought-leadership/), and co-author of [_Usability for the World_](/usability-for-the-world/).

My passion is empowering teams to make data-driven, human-centered decisions.
